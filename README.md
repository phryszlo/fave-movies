# fave-movies
Page written as class assignment to demonstrate using a different CSS file at three @media breakpoints.  
A different movie and graphics will display at three different screen sizes.  
Additional requirement was minimal interactivity, which here includes a hover effect over the movie titles, which pops up a movie synopsis.  
Resize window and hover titles to see results.
